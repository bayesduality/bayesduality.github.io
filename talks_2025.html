			 <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract: Modern deep learning systems impress with their capabilities but, at the same time, also face considerable challenges—requiring massive datasets, enormous computational resources, and raising growing concerns about their transparency and trustworthiness. In this talk, we will ask the question if it really has to be like this and discuss some of the major challenges that limit the success of deep learning on smaller scales. We will offer algorithmic and theoretical insights into sparsity, overparameterization, and their implicit biases. Exploiting our theoretical insights, we will adapt the implicit bias of standard optimizers according to a dynamic sparsity principle, which achieves performance boosts comparable to SAM, yet, with a complementary, novel mechanism.</p>
			 <p style="text-align: justify">Bio: I am a tenure-track faculty member at the Helmholtz Center CISPA, where I lead the Relational Machine Learning Group. Our research combines robust algorithm design and complex network science with the quest for a theoretical understanding of deep learning. Based on theoretical and experimental insights, we develop efficient models and algorithms that are robust to noise, adapt to a changing environment, and integrate information that can be available by small amounts of data and various forms of domain knowledge. This makes our approach well suited for the biomedical domain and sciences in general. While we care about solving real world problems in collaboration with domain experts, we have a special interest in problems related to glycans, gene regulation, and its alterations during cancer progression.</p>

			  <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract:In this talk, I describe how sparse modeling techniques can be extended and adapted for facilitating dynamic sparsity in neural models, where different neural pathways are activated depending on the input. The building block is a family of sparse transformations induced by Tsallis entropies called alpha-entmax, a drop-in replacement for softmax, which contains sparsemax as a particular case. Entmax transformations are differentiable and (unlike softmax) they can return sparse probability distributions, useful for routing, interpretability, efficiency, and length generalization, being less prone to phenomena such as dispersion, oversquashing, and representational collapse. They can also be used to design new Fenchel-Young loss functions, replacing the cross-entropy loss. Variants of these sparse transformations and losses have been applied with success to machine translation, natural language inference, visual question answering, Hopfield networks, reinforcement learning, and other tasks. I will discuss AdaSplash, an efficient implementation of entmax attention (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12082), and recent applications of these sparse losses to conformal prediction (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14773) and to generalized Bayesian inference (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10295).</p>

			 <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract: Sampling-based inference is often regarded as the gold standard for posterior inference in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), yet it continues to face skepticism regarding its practicality in large-scale or complex models. This perception has been challenged by recent methodological and computational advances that significantly broaden the scope of feasible applications. The presentation examines how sampling operates in BNNs, how performance can be improved through targeted adaptations, and why not all sampling procedures are equally effective. It further explores the role of implicit regularization induced by both the network architecture and the sampling dynamics. The discussion points toward future opportunities where sampling may redefine Bayesian deep learning, contingent on addressing current challenges in scalability, efficiency, and inference cost.

			 <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract: In this talk I will try to provide a few insights into in-context learning from a few recent works I've been involved in, and take a step back  and discuss the interactions between ICL and adaptation. While probably some of the hypotheses I'm going to try to put forward are relatively speculative, the more coherent part of the talk will be focused on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00661, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21676 and related work. In particular I will discuss some early empirical evidence that the reversal curse acts differently when resolved in context versus learned by gradient descent. I will also look at how transformers might be learning and storing facts, and how that can impact adapting or unlearning them. Overall the hope is to stimulate questions and to argue that sequential models, and transformers specifically, can have specific learning dynamics that might be worth studying and considering when we think about adaptation. </p>

			  <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract:How large should a neural network be? We argue that adjusting neural network size according to what the problem requires is important in continual learning settings, as well as for computational efficiency. We study this problem in the single-layer case, and give philosophical, theoretical, and practical arguments why approximations to Gaussian processes are a natural way to solve this problem. This leads to an elegant method for growing and shrinking neuron count in approximate Gaussian processes, with principles that prescribe how most hyperparameters should be set, which makes the method very automatic. We show sophisticated behaviours from this method, depending on dataset characteristics, e.g. saturation of neuron count in continual learning when data are redundant, and dropping of the neuron count when “grokking” occurs. We believe these ideas will be helpful in the generalisation to deep models.</p>
			  <p style="text-align: justify">Bio:I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, researching machine learning, and a Tutorial Fellow at Hertford College. Together with my research group, I work on three central questions: How do we find general patterns that allow generalization beyond the training set, without humans manually encoding them? (Equivariance, causality, continual learning…). How can we create neurons that automatically assemble their connectivity structure (architecture), while minimising the computational costs of the network as a whole? (Generalisation bounds, Bayesian model selection, MDL, meta-learning). How do we interact with the environment, while avoiding risk but learning as quickly as possible? (Bayesian optimisation, foundation models for industrial applications e.g. chemistry). These improvements are relevant for both small-data statistics (Gaussian processes), and large-data machine learning (neural networks). A wide range of research topics contribute towards these improvements, such as invariance, Bayesian inference, causality, meta-learning, local learning rules and generative modelling. My work has been presented at the leading machine learning conferences (e.g. NeurIPS and ICML), and includes a best paper award.</p>

			  <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract:Processing multimodal signals reliably is (still) a challenge. In this talk, I will argue that we need strong multimodal representations, good reasoning, and finally, enable models to become self-aware. Along these dimensions, I will discuss various research directions we are currently pursuing. This includes, among others, video & language modeling, selective prediction for visual question answering, multimodal fact checking, and backdoor attacks for unlearning in diffusion models. I will conclude with a discussion on future work.</p>

			  <p style="text-align: justify">Abstract: Driven by the goals of "augmenting diversity", increasing speed, reducing cost, the use of synthetic data as a replacement for human participants is gaining retraction in AI research and product development (Agnew et al., 2024). This talk critically examines the claim that synthetic data can “augment diversity”, arguing that this notion is empirically unsubstantiated, conceptually flawed, and epistemically harmful. While speed and cost-efficiency may be achievable, they often come at the expense of rigor, insight, and robust science. Drawing on research from dataset audits, model evaluations, Black feminist scholarship, and complexity science, I argue that replacing human participants with synthetic data risks producing both real-world and epistemic harms at worst and superficial knowledge and cheap science at best.</p>
